For anyone looking to make an addon with their own spells, it's quite simple!
Make sure our mod is a dependency in your mod, then refer to what we did in ModSpells

You just have to register your spells with our SpellRegisterer().register(spell)
To make a spell you just have to extend Spell like we did in our spells that you can also refer to

Happy coding!
